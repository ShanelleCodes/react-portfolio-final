            <p>With more than ten years in customer service, I'm not just a front-end web developer; 
                I'm your go-to girl for creating websites that people actually enjoy using. My knack for 
                understanding users' needs comes from a background of making customers happy, and I bring 
                that same vibe to my web projects. </p>
            <p>Let's team up to build sites that not only look cool 
                but also feel like a friendly conversation â€“ because a great user experience is the best 
                kind of customer service!</p>
